The AMKSS logo embodies the spirit of a dynamic and forward-looking organisation that is ready to face global challenges. Our vision to create a Culture Learning, a Mindset for Excellent and a Spirit of Service is portrayed by the fluidity of the brush strokes. Surging towards a shared vision, the three strokes represent a tripartite partnership among the school, parents and the community, and our commitment to a total systems approach in our work.

The solid 3-D pillar represents the firm foundation provided by the school in nurturing innovative and inquiring minds and inculcating a sense of responsibility and respect for self, family, school and nation. The ring that surrounds the school and its people represents the collective team spirit of the people who work together harmoniously in a gracious community.

Its is deliberately not fully encircled so as to allow scope for change, flexibility, creativity and growth.

The green circumference radiates energy and confidence, capturing the indomitable spirit of a progressive and forward-looking school in the midst of a globalised world.

  

The logo's fluidity and dynamism is balanced by the dignity and authority of the typeface which emphasizes our conviction to "**Always Strive for the Best**".
