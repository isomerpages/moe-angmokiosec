Students are expected to exercise discretion and self-discipline when using electronic devices.&nbsp;

All types of electronic game consoles (e.g. Nintendo; Play Station Portable; DS Light) are not allowed in school.

Personal audio players, handphones and electronic items are not encouraged in school.&nbsp; Students must take personal responsibility for their own electronic items.

However, the school understands the importance of the handphones in this day and age, and will allow students to bring their handphones to school, but their usage is restricted to certain locations in the school e.g. the canteen and school foyer. Handphones are not allowed in the classrooms and special rooms where lessons are conducted as they will cause distractions and disruptions to the flow of the lessons.

Parents are reminded that in case of an emergency, the school office remains a vital and appropriate point of contact and will ensure that your child/ ward is reached in the shortest time possible.

  

Students who do not demonstrate responsible use of electronic devices, including handphones, will have these devices retained by the school for 2 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

**<u>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</u>**  

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. Under the NDLP, students will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD).

The use of PLD will support students in the development of digital literacies and engage in self-directed and collaborative learning. It will also enhance teaching and learning.  

The PLD may be funded partly or fully using Edusave. Where required, funding support may be available for both Singapore and Non-Singapore citizen students.  

The school will engage students and parents regarding the NDLP in Term 1, with details to be provided once finalized.
