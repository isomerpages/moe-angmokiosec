Motto: “Teamwork and Trust: Dominating the court, one pass at a time”. <br><br>
For many, a passion for a certain sport can spark after years of doing it. However, my passion only began the year I entered Ang Mo Kio Secondary School (AMKSS) in 2020. That was when I first began my journey as a netballer and being someone who had zero background in the sport, I was just a timid and anxious girl, wondering if this is really something I can commit to. This all changed when I saw how welcoming the seniors and the teachers were. <br><br>
Netball is more than just a team sport to us, it's not about the score but the sweat and tears that we put in till the final whistle is blown.  Netball has allowed us to form extremely strong bonds with our teammates, teachers and coach becoming each other’s support system on and off the court. The camaraderie that we develop as we go through every little milestone together is something we are so extremely proud of. Together, we uphold our spirit and lead by our motto “Teamwork and Trust: Dominating the court, one pass at a time”. With countless memories created with my precious and remarkable team, it has been an honor to be able to lead them, as team captain. AMKSS Netball is not just about the trainings. We also actively take part in a wide variety of Values-In-Action activities, like volunteering for the Netball carnival “Pesta Sukan”, and taking part in friendly matches and carnivals. Through these, we were able to learn more about organising events, compete and bond while gaining insightful knowledge and experience in Netball.<br><br>
Earlier this year, the B Division girls embarked on their National School Games with great perseverance and passion to dominate the court. Though it was not the results we were expecting and was working hard towards, I am extremely proud of how well we did. Despite only training with our new coach for about two months and still adjusting to the change, the team put in great effort and teamwork, despite difficulties adjusting to the new change. It was an eye-opening experience seeing the team lifting each other’s spirits throughout the matches despite another team leading the score. Further in the year, it was the C Division’s turn to head on for their National School Games. They worked hard over the months, and I was proud to see them coming third for the South Zone Netball Championship. It was well deserved. There were numerous matches where the girls managed to overturn the score and this can only be achieved through their trust and teamwork among the girls, teachers and coach. <br><br>
As we look ahead to 2024, our hope is for the Netball club to continue to always strive for the best and live up to our motto “Teamwork and Trust: Dominating the court, one pass at a time”. <br>
