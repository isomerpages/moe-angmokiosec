The AMKBB team strives to instill the values of self-discipline, respect and teamwork among players. Our trainings are structured to allow students to develop physical strength and endurance, build their technique through drills, and foster team spirit during friendly matches. The CCA leaders take charge of leading their teams to complete specific training plans at the start of each session, such as skipping, running 2.4km and circuit exercises. In addition, the coach works closely with the boys to ensure they learn tactical plays and also communicate with one another on court.

  

In 2021, the National School Games was unable to continue due to the pandemic. However, the first AMKSS Basketball Championship was held. The basketballers formed 6 teams in the 'B' Division and 'C' division and played 3v3 matches against their CCA mates over a period of 6 weeks. Through this friendly internal competition, they were able to spur each other on to improve their skills and develop greater team spirit.

  

"During the ABC tournament, bonds between the players were strengthened as team captains drafted players and had to work with teammates who they may not have initially been close to. However, the team learned how to work together and understand one anotherâ€™s play style, increasing their chemistry. Players showed great team spirit and a never give up attitude as they strived to get their medals. In the end, it was a very eventful experience and everyone had fun." - Owen, 'B' Division Captain

  

"The ABC competition is something I am grateful for. Since the COVID-19 pandemic prevented us from participating in the National School Games for two years in a row, it served as a replacement for the team to once again feel the enjoy and excitement in playing a competition. Despite the ups and downs we faced during the ABC, I felt that we managed to understand each other's personalities much better than before. It allowed better communication between the team, and made me understand more deeply the value of sportsmanship and teamwork. The ABC was truly a unique and interesting experience that I will remember for a long time." - Darren, 'B' Division Vice Captain
