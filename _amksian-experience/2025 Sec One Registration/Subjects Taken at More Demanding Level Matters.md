#### Subjects Taken at More Demanding Level Matters
Eligible students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of these subjects.


Form Teachers will notify parents / guardians via phone call if their child / ward is eligible to take subjects at more demanding levels  on&nbsp;**<u>19&nbsp;December 2024 (Thursday)</u>.**

 We seek the assistance of parents/guardians to let the form teacher know whether their child / ward would like to take up the offer either
(i)
during the phone call on 19 Dec; or
(ii)
when the form teacher calls again on 23 December 2024 (Monday).&nbsp;**<u> 23&nbsp;December 2024 (Monday)</u>.**
