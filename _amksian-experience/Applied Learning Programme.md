The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Ang Mo Kio Secondary School (AMKSS) aims to create opportunities for students to apply what they have learned in class in areas of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics) through activities that&nbsp;engage the hands and minds of our students.

  

Students are given opportunities to apply the knowledge that they have acquired about Environmental Sustainability through a series of hands-on project embedded within the curriculum. Our students undergo an enhanced ALP Curriculum that equips them with knowledge relevant to the challenges faced in a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world. The Curriculum, comprises three major themes, namely Biodiversity, Energy and Resources, and Electronics &amp; Coding. Students have opportunities to collaborate with our growing list of partners and work experiences with various industries.
