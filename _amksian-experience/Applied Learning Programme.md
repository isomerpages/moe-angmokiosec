#### ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH STEM
<br>
Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Environmental Sustainability through STEM aims to equip students with the knowledge, skills and passion necessary to tackle pressing environmental challenges. By integrating the principles of biodiversity, energy resources, coding and electronics, our programme provides a comprehensive approach to fostering sustainability practices. Through engaging our students through our unique curriculum and learning journeys, we aim to provide enriching experiences to develop a deep understanding of environmental issues in our students. 
<br>
<br>
The ALP journey begins by immersing our students in the world of biodiversity. They will explore the importance of ecological balance, species preservation and the interdependencies within ecosystems. Students will engage in hands-on activities such as field trips to local nature reserves, conducting biodiversity surveys. These experiences will deepen their understanding of the delicate relationship between living organisms and their environments.
<br>
<br>
Understanding the significance of energy resources is crucial for promoting sustainability. Through this module, students will explore various renewable and non-renewable energy sources, their impact on the environment, and the importance of energy conservation. Students will be involved in designing and building renewable energy models. Students will learn to apply innovative and sustainable solutions to address energy challenges.<br>
<br>
Recognizing the pivotal role of technology in driving environmental sustainability, students will learn coding and electronics skills to develop eco-friendly solutions. They will be introduced to microcontrollers, sensors, and programming languages to create projects such as smart irrigation systems, and energy-efficient devices. This hands-on approach will enable students to apply their STEM knowledge in real-world contexts and foster their creativity and problem-solving abilities.<br>
<br>
Our programme also offers a wide range of learning journeys and enrichment opportunities to broaden students’ perspectives and provide them with exposure to related fields. These include visits to research institutions and sustainable businesses. Students will interact with experts, participate in workshops and engage in collaborative projects. Students will also get the chance to participate in Applied Learning Modules (ApLM@Poly). These experiences will not only deepen their understanding but also inspire them to pursue further studies or careers in related fields.<br>
<br>
We hope to provide a holistic educational experience by integrating various disciplines, enabling students to see the interconnectedness of environmental sustainability and STEM. Students will gain hands-on experience and be equipped with practical skills to address environmental challenges. Through the programme, students can foster a deeper understanding on environmental issues, and be empowered to become environmentally conscious individuals. Our programme offers students a unique opportunity to explore the crucial intersection of environmental conservation and STEM disciplines and inspire students to make a positive impact on the environment. <br><br>

#### Applied Learning Programme (ALP) the AMKSS Way

##### Key Takeaways
“I enjoy the school’s ALP because it offers students many opportunities to engage in hands-on projects, such as creating a bottle that lights up the bulb.’

“Growing the vegetables and being able to harvest them is very satisfying!”

The above reflections resonate the common sentiments of the Secondary 1 cohort at Ang Mo Kio Secondary School (AMKSS) who underwent the Biodiversity and Energy and Resources modules under ALP @AMKSS.

Multi-disciplinary Learning Festival 2023 
The recent AMKSS Learning Festival serves as a valuable platform for multi-disciplinary and authentic learning experiences. The ALP Committee innovatively explored collaborating with the Humanities Department to organise an ALP–GI (Geographical Investigation) learning journey to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve for the Secondary Ones. 

Not only did the students gain the chance for hands-on learning, but they also developed strong appreciation for the diversity in the mangrove forest and became more aware of the intricate relationship between human actions and nature. 

Le Xuan (IF)’s reflection testifies to the deep learning she gained from this learning journey: ‘I learnt that mangroves support biotic life well and is very important in many ways. A lot of animals live near the mangroves, and I also learnt about the mutualistic relationship between organisms. Sometimes I do not recycle and that can lead to the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I learnt more about the importance of ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’. We should also take actions towards a more sustainable way of living. I am encouraged and will motivate others to do so too, so that more people can make a positive change to our environment.’ 

Ian Mui, Humanities teacher and co-organiser of this ALP-GI learning journey, shares: ‘Such experiential learning opportunities give students the chance of first-hand exploration of their surroundings outside the confines of the classroom, giving rise to novel observations of the various flora and fauna’s interactions with their surroundings, as well as human interference and influence. It was heartening to see students drawing connections between what they observed as possible extension of human interference and their daily life actions. This authentic exploration of Sungei Buloh gets students to reflect on their own actions, further developing themselves as concerned citizens for the environment.’ 

To further their learning about food security and sustainability, and its importance, as well as how farming helps promote a more inclusive and healthy society, a visit to the Edible Garden City was planned for the festival. Through this learning journey, the students learnt about the closed-loop and minimal-waste model of growing vegetables in the urban setting. 

##### Moving on… 
Heartened by the rich learning and student engagement in these Learning Festival programmes, AMKSS will continue to explore and organise meaningful and authentic learning opportunities for our students to grow holistically in areas of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics).
