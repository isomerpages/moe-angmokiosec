#### Ang Mo Kio Secondary School Direct School Admission Exercise 2022

Direct School Admission (DSA) is an MOE initiative designed to give selected schools greater flexibility in student admission, so that a more diverse range of student achievements and talents can be recognised.

  

In April 2008, MOE approved the school’s application for niche development in the area of Symphonic Band. Since then, Ang Mo Kio Secondary School (AMKSS) has been offering discretionary admission to talented band students who displayed the passion for band music. With the introduction of the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Arts Education, AMKSS has offered DSA places for a wider range of performing arts from 2017. From 2019, we have broadened our DSA offerings to include the area of Sports as well. Up to 20% of the Secondary One vacancies will be offered for DSA places for **Concert Band, Choir, Modern Dance, Malay Dance, English Drama, Badminton and Volleyball**.

  

In line with the school's belief to provide a balanced and holistic education, the Co-Curricular Programmes have been designed to allow our students to experience an enriching learning journey over the four years in school, and to challenge each member to attain greater heights in their chosen interest/talent area in performing arts or sports.

#### Concert Band

Ang Mo Kio Secondary School Concert Band was first founded in the 1980s as a military band. It was converted to a symphonic band in 2001 and has a current strength of over 100 members. The Band has achieved Gold Awards and Certificates of Distinction for consecutive SYF Arts Presentation since 2005 and is currently led by conductors Mr Sebastian Koh and Mr Desmond Chow.

  

Over the years, the band has enthralled the public with different genres of music catering to different audiences at various performance venues such as Esplanade Concert Hall and Victoria Concert Hall, as well as Singapore Botanic Gardens. In 2018, the Band collaborated with NParks to bring arts to the community by performing at the Gardens by the Bay for the Singapore Garden Festival, and for Artists’ Night Out at Dhoby Ghaut Green during the Singapore Night Festival. In addition, the Band had the privilege to perform at Istana during the National Day Open House in 2017. The Band also had the opportunities to take part in various SYF events, such as the Parade of Bands (2016), Virtual Music Ensemble (2017), and SYF Celebrations - Festival Concert at Esplanade Theatre (2019).

  

Our comprehensive band programme aims to instil a passion for music-making in every member and inculcate lifelong learning in music appreciation. Besides acquiring the skills of playing an instrument, all band members will undergo music theory lessons such that they complement the learning and playing of band music. Our programme also seeks to provide band members with an enriching band experience through concerts, public performances, band exchanges with foreign school bands and appreciating music in general to encourage lifelong learning in arts.

#### Choir

Ang Mo Kio Secondary School Choir has a current strength of about 60 dedicated members, comprising Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass; and is helmed by talented chorister-conductor, Ms Cherie Chai. The choir achieved a Certificate of Distinction and Certificate of Accomplishment in SYF Arts Presentations in 2019 and 2017 respectively.

  

To hone our students’ vocal and public presentation skills, the choir performs in public, participates in choral exchanges with other schools and attends vocal workshops, master classes and concerts every year. Theory sessions based on the ABRSM syllabus are also carried out for the choir members to better equip them with knowledge and versatility in music.

  

The Choir showcases its talents at various school performances such as Awards Day, AMKsian Showcase and our school’s biennial event, Night of Music, Arts and Dance (NOMAD). In the years 2015 and 2016, we had joint concert performances, “The Reason We Sing” and “The Reason We Sing II” respectively, with other school choirs at public venues and subsequently participated in the Voices of Singapore Festival at CHIJmes in 2019.

  

Besides singing, the Choir organizes activities to instill, develop and promote self-discipline, teamwork, confidence and commitment in our choristers. Every chorister has a responsibility to serve both the Choir and the community; as led by the Choir's Executive Committee based on our philosophy that every AMKsian Chorister "Always Strive For the Best - to Sing, to Share and to Serve"

#### Dance Club

The Dance Club specialises in 2 broad categories of dance, namely **Modern and Malay Dance**. Two external instructors, who are professionally-trained dancers, coach the two dance groups in the technical and artistic aspects of the dance. Through our yearly Dance auditions conducted at the start of the year, we hope to recruit members who are passionate about dance and are committed to undergo rigorous training to build on their flexibility, physical strength and stamina.

  

The **Modern Dance** group strives to nurture and develop versatile performers. Through dance, students are empowered to express their emotions and personal stories through movement and rhythm. The dance group achieved the Certificate of Distinction in 2015, 2019 and 2021 and the Certificate of Accomplishment in 2017 at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. The group also had the honour of performing for the SYF Opening Concert at Esplanade in 2016.

  

The **Malay Dance** consists of an exuberant group of students with passion in Malay Dance. We provide opportunities for students to learn and appreciate Malay Dance and culture. We aim to develop our students to be graceful dancers and disciplined students. The group achieved the Certificate of Distinction in 2015 and 2017 and the Certificate of Accomplishment in 2019 and 2021 at the SYF Arts Presentation.

  

Through our Dance camps and Dance Exchange Programme, we give our students opportunities to learn from other instructors as well as dancers from other schools. These programmes help build confidence in our students when performing on stage. Besides showcasing their skills to a variety of audiences, they will also be trained to think critically about artistic works; relate aesthetically, affectively and cognitively to the dance art form and the contexts of artistic works; as well as explore and experiment with the art form.

#### Drama

The Drama Club strives to develop professionalism in our members through different forms of theatre performances and giving every member opportunities to participate in drama performances in various roles. Members learn useful acting skills and develop stage awareness, as well as to improvise, think creatively and work together as a team to put up short performances. Our members are also encouraged to take turns leading the warm-up sessions and games. Through these activities, Drama Club members build up their confidence and develop leadership skills.

  

In the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2017 and 2019, our Drama Club achieved the Certificate of Distinction. In 2021, we achieved a Certificate of Accomplishment. From 2016 to 2018, the Drama Club also participated in re: ACT, a Theatre for Social Advocacy project created by inwardBOUND in partnership with different charity organisations which cumulated into a performance where different secondary schools represented each charity's cause.

#### Badminton

Badminton – referred to by some as ‘The Fastest Racquet Sport in the World’ – requires agility, power, mental and physical prowess as well as endurance. Badminton places tremendous demands on those who practice the sport.

  

Ang Mo Kio Secondary School has made a name for herself in this tough but satisfying sport which hones delicate wrist-work skills, nimble footwork and perseverance. Team AMKSS trains thrice a week in order to help the students develop badminton skills as well as their grit and persistence in getting things right.

  

Over the years, our team has consistently made our presence felt in the South Zone Interschool Badminton Tournament. In 2018, our B Division Boys and Girls fought hard to clinch third position. The following year, our B Division Girls achieved fourth position. In 2021, our B Girls finished third and in 2022, emerged second in the South Zone Badminton Competition.

  

Team AMKSS seeks opportunities that enable our players and leaders to plan, organize and implement a variety of programmes to benefit both the school and community. Annually, we organize a primary school badminton competition, the “AMKSS Invitational”, to promote the sport, encourage friendly sparring and help raise the standards of the sport amongst primary school students. In addition, players assist in the coaching of students in Ang Mo Kio and Townsville Primary Schools as part of our partnership and outreach efforts with our community.

#### Volleyball

Ang Mo Kio’s Volleyball Team was established in 1999 and has grown from strength to strength over the 21 years. The Team has consistently punched above its weight at the South Zone and National competitions, finishing among the top schools in both competitions. In 2019, the B Girls and B Boys emerged 2nd and 4th respectively in the Zonal Championships. Our B Girls finished third in 2021, and emerged runners-up in the 2022 South Zone Championship. Our Girls team is currently coached by Mr Teo Kee Theng and our Boys team is coached by Mr Gary Cheung Wan Yang. Over the years, the Team has produced talented individuals who went on to don National colours and represent the country. In 2018, one of our girls, Seah Yun Zhen Desiree was selected to represent Singapore at the 2018 ASEAN Schools Games, while our alumni, Alicia Tan Kai Yun (graduate of 2017) represented Singapore at the 2018 Asian U19 Beach Volleyball Championships in Thailand.

Our Volleyball programme aims to develop and sustain our students’ skills, passion and interest in Volleyball. We also strive to achieve sustained excellence in zonal and national competitions. And most importantly, we are driven to inculcate values such as teamwork, discipline and resilience in them.
