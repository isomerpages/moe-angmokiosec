Ang Mo Kio Secondary School Direct School Admission Exercise 2022
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Direct School Admission (DSA) is an MOE initiative designed to give selected schools greater flexibility in student admission, so that a more diverse range of student achievements and talents can be recognised.

  

In April 2008, MOE approved the school’s application for niche development in the area of Symphonic Band. Since then, Ang Mo Kio Secondary School (AMKSS) has been offering discretionary admission to talented band students who displayed the passion for band music. With the introduction of the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Arts Education, AMKSS has offered DSA places for a wider range of performing arts from 2017. From 2019, we have broadened our DSA offerings to include the area of Sports as well. Up to 20% of the Secondary One vacancies will be offered for DSA places for **Concert Band, Choir, Modern Dance, Malay Dance, English Drama, Badminton and Volleyball**.

  

In line with the school's belief to provide a balanced and holistic education, the Co-Curricular Programmes have been designed to allow our students to experience an enriching learning journey over the four years in school, and to challenge each member to attain greater heights in their chosen interest/talent area in performing arts or sports.

Concert Band
------------

Ang Mo Kio Secondary School Concert Band was first founded in the 1980s as a military band. It was converted to a symphonic band in 2001 and has a current strength of over 100 members. The Band has achieved Gold Awards and Certificates of Distinction for consecutive SYF Arts Presentation since 2005 and is currently led by conductors Mr Sebastian Koh and Mr Desmond Chow.

  

Over the years, the band has enthralled the public with different genres of music catering to different audiences at various performance venues such as Esplanade Concert Hall and Victoria Concert Hall, as well as Singapore Botanic Gardens. In 2018, the Band collaborated with NParks to bring arts to the community by performing at the Gardens by the Bay for the Singapore Garden Festival, and for Artists’ Night Out at Dhoby Ghaut Green during the Singapore Night Festival. In addition, the Band had the privilege to perform at Istana during the National Day Open House in 2017. The Band also had the opportunities to take part in various SYF events, such as the Parade of Bands (2016), Virtual Music Ensemble (2017), and SYF Celebrations - Festival Concert at Esplanade Theatre (2019).

  

Our comprehensive band programme aims to instil a passion for music-making in every member and inculcate lifelong learning in music appreciation. Besides acquiring the skills of playing an instrument, all band members will undergo music theory lessons such that they complement the learning and playing of band music. Our programme also seeks to provide band members with an enriching band experience through concerts, public performances, band exchanges with foreign school bands and appreciating music in general to encourage lifelong learning in arts.

Choir
-----

Ang Mo Kio Secondary School Choir has a current strength of about 60 dedicated members, comprising Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass; and is helmed by talented chorister-conductor, Ms Cherie Chai. The choir achieved a Certificate of Distinction and Certificate of Accomplishment in SYF Arts Presentations in 2019 and 2017 respectively.

  

To hone our students’ vocal and public presentation skills, the choir performs in public, participates in choral exchanges with other schools and attends vocal workshops, master classes and concerts every year. Theory sessions based on the ABRSM syllabus are also carried out for the choir members to better equip them with knowledge and versatility in music.

  

The Choir showcases its talents at various school performances such as Awards Day, AMKsian Showcase and our school’s biennial event, Night of Music, Arts and Dance (NOMAD). In the years 2015 and 2016, we had joint concert performances, “The Reason We Sing” and “The Reason We Sing II” respectively, with other school choirs at public venues and subsequently participated in the Voices of Singapore Festival at CHIJmes in 2019.

  

Besides singing, the Choir organizes activities to instill, develop and promote self-discipline, teamwork, confidence and commitment in our choristers. Every chorister has a responsibility to serve both the Choir and the community; as led by the Choir's Executive Committee based on our philosophy that every AMKsian Chorister "Always Strive For the Best - to Sing, to Share and to Serve"
