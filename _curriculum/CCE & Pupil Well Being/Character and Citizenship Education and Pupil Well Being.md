#### Goals

<h5><u>CCE 2021 aims to develop in our students:</u></h5>

  

a) Good character: Have a sound moral compass, a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence;

  

b) Resilience and social-emotional well-being: Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;

  

c) Active citizenship: Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation; and

  

d) Future readiness: Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work.

#### Initiatives / Activities / Programme

<h5><u>R<sup>3</sup>ICH Awards</u></h5>

In order to recognize exemplary students of character who demonstrate the school values, R3ICH Awards are presented to the deserving students.

<h5><u>Values-in-Action Programme</u></h5>

In the course of each student’s journey in AMKSS, they will go through a series of Values-in-Action activities that will expose the students to serving the community. It is our belief that every student can be an active and compassionate contributor to society. Students will have the opportunity to experience a variety of themes, such as environment, elderly, children and social needs, to have a better understanding of the felt needs of the community.

  

Activities include:

  

*   Environmental awareness and conservation
*   Beach cleaning
*   Interaction with Elderly of AWWA home and St. Luke's Eldercare
*   Food Drive Collection
*   Food Drive management with Food from the Heart
*   Advocacy Project
*   CCA-organised VIA activities
*   Self-Initiated VIA Activities

  

<h5><u>National Education</u></h5>

The school’s National Education programme is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions:

  

*   A sense of belonging
*   A sense of reality
*   A sense of hope
*   The will to act

  

The school celebrates the four National Education Commemorative Days in a year: Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. Activities are carefully planned to guide students to deepen their understanding of the citizenship dispositions and to apply it in their journey as AMKsians. Beyond the commemorative days, students will also be exposed to current affairs through their lessons and also on learning journeys organised by the school or their CCAs.
